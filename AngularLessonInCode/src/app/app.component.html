<h2> Static Content Goes Here </h2> 
<!-- 
  -- Adds content of routed component after router-outlet tag. Any component
  -- call prior to this tag renders normally before routed content. This is 
  -- handy in case of creating pages with static content on each link like navbar.

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
